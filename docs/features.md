## Validation of FHIR implementations

Need to test your FHIR implementation for correctness? FHIR [implementation guides](https://hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html) have different requirements on your implementation. From country-specific adaptations (e.g. [Swiss FHIR specifications](http://fhir.ch)), to requirements for specific use cases like the [International Patient Summary (IPS)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/), or your own organization’s internal FHIR implementation guide. You can configure Matchbox to meet your requirements, and validate your FHIR resources directly with an API during testing or in production. Validation is based on the official [HL7 Java reference validator](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core) in accordance with the provided terminologies. An external terminology server can also be configured, and you can validate your implementation through the open FHIR API or through a simple GUI. Matchbox can also be integrated with [EVS Client](https://gazelle.ihe.net/EVSClient/home.seam), the validation tool from [IHE](https://www.ihe.net) that is used during Connectathons.

## Mapping health data to and from FHIR using the FHIR mapping language

Need to map your health data into FHIR and want to share your mapping to FHIR in a re-usable way? The [FHIR mapping language](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html) allows you to define mapping in a text representation and transform them to FHIR [StructureMap](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html) resources. Those resources can then be provided in FHIR implementation guides. Matchbox applies the mapping to your own data to create FHIR-compatible data sets. It also checks that the mapping conforms with the included validation stack. In Switzerland, this approach is tested with mapping between CDA and FHIR exchange formats for medication ([CDA-FHIR-Maps](http://fhir.ch/ig/cda-fhir-maps/index.html)).

## Questionnaire form filler with FHIR data extraction

Want to collect health data? Questionnaires and forms are used to capture a wide range of data that can be used by healthcare systems for public health reporting, from administrative and claims data to clinical and research information. Guidance for the use of these FHIR [Questionnaires](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) and [QuestionnaireResponses](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html) is included in the [Structured Data Capture (SDC)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/) implementation guide. Together with the [StructureMap-based extraction mechanism](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-extr-smap.html), it defines how to generate FHIR resources from the captured data. Matchbox includes a general form viewer using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) that can be used to collect health data based on questionnaires. Once questionnaires have been completed, the Matchbox form-filling application extracts and validates the data in combination with Matchbox.

## Integration kit for Mobile Access Gateway and Swiss Electronic Patient Record

Need to integrate your application with the Swiss [Electronic Patient Record (EPR)](https://www.patientendossier.ch/en)? The [Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)](https://github.com/ahdis/MobileAccessGateway) is an open source software to implement the proposed [Swiss EPR mHealth specifications](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html). It enables you to connect your application to the Swiss EPR via FHIR. Matchbox provides a test application to perform all the necessary MAG API calls, including those from patient identification (PIXm) to document publication or access (MHD). The combination of Matchbox and Mobile Access Gateway ensures that you publish only exchange formats that conform with Swiss EPR requirements, and allows you to transform between different formats, such as CDA and FHIR, as necessary.
